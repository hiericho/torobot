## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running for development or self-hosting, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10 or higher
*   pip (Python package installer)
*   Git (for cloning the repository)
*   A Discord Bot Token (Create one on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hiericho/torobot
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root project directory:
    ```env
    DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual bot token.

5.  **Configure the bot (if necessary):**
    Review `config.py` or the configuration section in `bot.py`/`main.py` for any default settings you might want to adjust (e.g., `CURRENT_SEASON`, `API_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`).

6.  **Run the bot:**
    ```bash
    python bot.py  # Or your main script name (e.g., main.py)
    ```

## Usage

Once the bot is running and invited to your Discord server:

1.  Make sure the bot has the necessary permissions in the channels where you want to use it (Read Messages, Send Messages, Embed Links, Use Application Commands).
2.  Start using the slash commands listed in the [Commands](#commands) section (e.g., `/today`, `/playerstats LeBron James`).

*   `API_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`: Timeout for calls to the NBA API.
*   `DEFAULT_STREAMING_URL`: Default URL used for some "Streaming" statuses.

Environment variables (like `DISCORD_TOKEN`) are managed in the `.env` file.
